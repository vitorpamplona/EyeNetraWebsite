                        <p class="lead text-center">Effective: June 19, 2018</p>

                        <p class="lead">EyeNetra, Inc. (We) builds a range of tools that help eye care providers service patients worldwide. The tools measure medical information of the eyes and allow eye care providers to safely store and fulfill their services. When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.</p>

                        <p class="lead">This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.</p>

                        <p class="lead"><b>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. </b></p>

                        <p class="lead"><b> BY USING OUR SERVICES, OUR APPLICATIONS OR DEVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.</b></p>

                        <h3>1 - WHAT DO WE CAPTURE? </h3>

                        <p class="lead">There are four stages of information we capture: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="lead"><b>When you browse our websites and applications</b>, we automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address, which can determine your location, in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system. We use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience, analyze site traffic, personalize content, and serve targeted advertisements. </li>

                            <li class="lead"><b>When you purchase</b> something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address, email address and payment information. We may send you emails about our store, new products, best practices and other updates.</li>

                            <li class="lead"><b>When you use the devices</b>, we capture your patient's refractive error. Such information remains anonymized until you associate them with notes identifying the patient or the patient profile itself. The applications capture the location of the exam, date and time of the usage, pictures used to compute the optical powers of the devices, light sensor information, accelerometer information, your EyeNetra phone's information (such as serial number and phone number), the information in range of NFC and Bluetooth devices, and the applications have the power to change your Phone’s Settings information in order to make sure the devices run accurately. You should assume that every activity in the app is being tracked and stored, including when the patient is running through the examination process. That data is again anonymized and submitted to our servers, where we run algorithms to understand the device’s usage and enhance the results. </li>

                            <li class="lead"><b>When you use the Insight platform</b> to connect the anonymized measurements to a patient profile. On Insight, patients can book appointments, insert the current medical status, have the anonymized measurements be associated with them, be prescribed from the on-line portal and be charged on their credit cards. Insight is a HIPAA compliant data storage for all that information. The data is encrypted in our servers and only the users that you gave access to will be able to see the data.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>2 - HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION?</h3>

                        <p class="lead">We may use your Personal Information for the following purposes:</p>

                            <li class="lead">To market the applications and services; </li>
                            <li class="lead">For any other purposes disclosed at the time the information is collected and to which you consent;</li>

                        <ul>

                        <p class="lead">Service Recipients may revoke all or part of the consents granted to us above in writing at any time by sending a signed and dated statement to EyeNetra as set forth in the “How do I withdraw my consent” section below.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that we receive and/or collect your Health Information through the Website from a Covered Entity (as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA“)), in its capacity as a Business Associate (as defined under HIPAA), such information will be subject to protection under the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA and Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical Health Act of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“HITECH Act“) set forth in the Business Associate Agreement which will govern EyeNetra’s use and disclosure of such Health Information, and shall supersede the foregoing in the event of an inconsistency between the two.</p>

Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the personal information. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we will put in place measures to adequately protect that personal information as described in this Privacy Policy so that same level of protection is applied to that personal information as would be required were it processed in the country in which the personal information was originally collected.</p>

                        <h3>4 - CONSENT</h3>

                        <p class="lead">How do you get my consent?</p>

                        <p class="lead">When you sign up for the applications, devices or when you purchase the products on-line.</p>

                        <p class="lead">When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.</p>

                        <h3>5 - SHOPIFY</h3>

                        <p class="lead">Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. They store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Payment:</p>

                        <p class="lead">If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted. All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</p>

                        <p class="lead">PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

                        <h3>6 – AMAZON CLOUD</h3>

                        <p class="lead">Our Insight Portal is hosted on Amazon AWS servers. They provide us with the hardware to run our applications and store its contents. Your patients data are stored here in an encrypted fashion and cannot be seen by Shopify, for instance. Not even Amazon employees can have access to the data. </p>

                        <p class="lead">Patient Payment:</p>

                        <p class="lead">If you choose a direct payment gateway inside Insight to enable your patients to pay you for their services, Stripe, the credit card processing company, stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your patient’s purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.</p>

                        <p class="lead">All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. You can read Stripe’s privacy policy <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy/">here</a>.</p>

                        <h3>7 - OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>

                        <p class="lead">In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>

                        <p class="lead">For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>

                        <p class="lead">As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Links: </p>

                        <p class="lead">When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Advertising Cookies:</p>

                        <p class="lead">Our Websites uses Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel and Linked-in tracking to help us learn about who visits our site and what pages are being looked at. If you are logged in to those platforms while browsing in our website, such platforms will be able to track you inside our system. We also use JavaScript tags to help us tailor and optimize our Services and provide you relevant advertisements outside of our Services. </p>

                        <p class="lead">We use web beacons, also known as “clear gif” technology, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. Unlike cookies, which can be stored on a user’s mobile device’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>

                        <h3>8 - SECURITY</h3>

                        <p class="lead">To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the databases of the third parties with which we may share such Information, nor can we guarantee that the Information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to us may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.</p>

                        <p class="lead">If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption.
